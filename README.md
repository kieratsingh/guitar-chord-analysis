# guitar-chord-analysis
Music forms an integral part of our lives and human behavior. With newer tools and technology learning music is a skill which is sought after. In this work we explore a common problem faced by many novice musicians. For a given complex chord on guitar, there are possible chords which can be less complex and easily playable. 
Using this knowledge, we build an algorithm which, on the basis of physics principles, graph theory and music theory, suggests alternative chords which are easier to play and can be used to learn guitar at a faster rate and without the common troubles faced at the initial stages. These suggestions can be incorporated to create better, simpler and more unique chord progressions as well as better musical flow during performances. 
Furthermore, in the future, such models can be used and built on to generate entire progressions suited to the emotion required and also potentially generate instrumental solos over a specific chord progression.
